# **Sigmoid Linear Units (SiLU)**

<br>

SiLU is an activation function commonly used in neural networks. It is computed by multiplying the [Sigmoid function](/research_notes/activation_functions/sigmoid_activation_functions/sigmoid.md) with its input.

SiLU was initially introduced in the context of GELUs and has also been explored in other research papers, such as "[Sigmoid-Weighted Linear Units for Neural Network Function Approximation in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.03118v3.pdf)" and "[Swish: a Self-Gated Activation Function](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05941v1.pdf)".

SiLU combines the properties of the Sigmoid function, which maps inputs to values between 0 and 1, with a linear transformation. This combination results in a smooth and differentiable nonlinearity, making SiLU suitable for gradient-based optimization algorithms used in neural network training.

[GELU](/research_notes/activation_functions/smooth_activation_functions/gelu.md), where SiLU was originally coined, investigates the effectiveness of the SiLU activation function in capturing complex patterns and achieving efficient learning in deep learning models. Other research papers have also studied SiLU in the context of reinforcement learning and compared its performance to other activation functions.

In summary, SiLU is an activation function obtained by multiplying the Sigmoid function with the input. It offers a smooth and differentiable nonlinearity, which can be advantageous for neural network training. SiLU has been extensively studied in various research papers for its potential benefits in capturing complex patterns and improving learning efficiency.

## **Definition**

$$SiLU(x) = x\sigma{(x)}$$

$$SiLU\grave{(}x) = \sigma{(x)}(1 + x(1-\sigma{(x)}))$$

Here, $\sigma$ is the Sigmoid activation function.

## **Properties**

- **Smooth And Differentiable:** SiLU provides a smooth nonlinearity due to the multiplication of the Sigmoid function with the input. The differentiability of SiLU enables the use of gradient-based optimization algorithms, facilitating efficient learning and convergence.
- **Non-Zero Gradient For Both Positive And Negative Inputs:** Unlike some other activation functions, such as [ReLU](/research_notes/activation_functions/rectifier_activation_functions/relu.md), SiLU retains a non-zero gradient for both positive and negative inputs. This property can help alleviate the issue of "dying neurons" and improve information flow during training.
- **Computational Efficiency:** SiLU can be efficiently computed using the sigmoid function, which is readily available in most deep learning frameworks. This computational efficiency can contribute to faster training and inference times.
- **Experimental Effectiveness:** SiLU has shown promise in various research papers, including its original introduction in GELUs and subsequent experimentation in reinforcement learning and self-gated activation functions. It has demonstrated potential in capturing complex patterns and improving learning performance.

## **Advantages**

* Provides a smooth and differentiable nonlinearity.
* Retains a non-zero gradient for positive and negative inputs.
* Can be computed efficiently using the sigmoid function.
* Has demonstrated potential in capturing complex patterns and improving learning performance.

## **Limitations**

* Lacks a direct probabilistic interpretation or clear thresholding behavior.
* Has a predefined mathematical form, limiting its flexibility compared to activations with learnable parameters or customizable adjustments.
* Relies on the sigmoid function, which may introduce variations in performance and behavior across different implementations or frameworks.

### **Note:**

It's important to note that the advantages and limitations of using a particular activation function may vary depending on the specific context and problem at hand. Experimentation and evaluation on a case-by-case basis are recommended to determine the most suitable activation function for a given neural network.
