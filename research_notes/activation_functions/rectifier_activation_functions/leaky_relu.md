# **Leaky Rectified Linear Unit (Leaky ReLU)**

<br>

The Leaky ReLU is an activation function that enhances the [Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)](/research_notes/activation_functions/rectifier_activation_functions/relu.md) by introducing a small slope for negative input values instead of a flat slope. Unlike ReLU, which sets negative values to zero, Leaky ReLU allows a small, non-zero output for negative inputs.

The slope coefficient, typically a small constant value, is predetermined and remains fixed during training. This distinguishes Leaky ReLU from activations where the slope is learned as part of the model optimization process.

Leaky ReLU is particularly popular in tasks where sparse gradients can pose challenges, such as training generative adversarial networks (GANs). Sparse gradients occur when many neurons in a network have zero or near-zero gradients, leading to slow learning or halted training progress. By introducing a non-zero slope for negative values, Leaky ReLU helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem associated with traditional ReLU activations, facilitating more stable and efficient training.

In summary, Leaky ReLU extends ReLU by allowing a small, non-zero slope for negative inputs. This predefined slope coefficient helps address the issue of sparse gradients, making Leaky ReLU especially useful in tasks such as training GANs or scenarios where gradient sparsity is a concern.

## **Definition**

$$Leaky ReLU(x)=\left\{ \begin{array}{cl} x & : \ x \gt 0 \\ \alpha x & : \ x \le 0 \end{array} \right.$$

$$Leaky ReLU\grave{(}x)=\left\{ \begin{array}{cl} 1 & : \ x \gt 0 \\ \alpha & : \ x \lt 0 \end{array} \right.$$

## **Properties**

- **Avoidance of Dead Neurons:** Leaky ReLU prevents the issue of "dead neurons" by allowing a small, non-zero slope for negative inputs, ensuring the propagation of gradients during backpropagation.
- **Mitigation of Gradient Saturation:** Leaky ReLU addresses the vanishing gradient problem by enabling effective gradient flow for negative inputs, promoting improved learning and convergence.
- **Sparse Activation:** Similar to ReLU, Leaky ReLU promotes sparse activation, leading to efficient memory usage and computational performance.
- **Easy Implementation:** Leaky ReLU is straightforward to implement, requiring a simple modification to the standard ReLU function by introducing a predefined slope coefficient.

## **Advantages**

* Prevents dead neurons and gradient saturation, facilitating better gradient flow and promoting more effective learning in deep neural networks.
* The sparse activation induced by Leaky ReLU optimizes memory utilization and computational efficiency.
* Can be easily integrated into existing models and frameworks with minimal modifications.

## **Limitations**

* Determining an appropriate slope coefficient in Leaky ReLU requires careful hyperparameter tuning, which may involve experimentation to find the optimal value.
* The slope coefficient in Leaky ReLU remains fixed throughout training, limiting the activation function's ability to adapt and optimize the slope based on data and network dynamics.
* The non-zero slope for negative inputs in Leaky ReLU introduces linearity, which can result in the loss of some information encoded in negative values, potentially impacting the model's ability to capture specific patterns or relationships.

### **Note:**

It's important to note that the advantages and limitations of using a particular activation function may vary depending on the specific context and problem at hand. Experimentation and evaluation on a case-by-case basis are recommended to determine the most suitable activation function for a given neural network.
